<h1> Project Title: Analysis of Global Water Access and Annual Rates of Change (ARC) </h1>

<b> Objective: </b> 
<p> This project focuses on analyzing the global access to basic water services between 2000 and 2020. The analysis includes calculating the Annual Rates of Change (ARC) in national, rural, and urban access to water services for multiple countries. </p>

<h2> Key Steps in the Analysis: </h2>

<b> Dataset Preparation: </b>

<ul> 
<li> Worked with a dataset that contained water access data from 2015 to 2020 for multiple countries, focusing on national, rural, and urban populations. </li>
<li> Data cleaning included handling missing values, identifying duplicates, and sorting the dataset by country and year. </li>
</ul>

<b> Calculating Year Differences: </b>
<ul>
<li>I calculated the average difference between years for each country and ensured that the dataset was free of erroneous duplicates. </li>
<li> The average difference in years between available data points was 4.75 years. </li>
</ul>

<b> Annual Rates of Change (ARC): </b>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the Annual Rates of Change (ARC) to measure how access to basic water services evolved between two years. The ARC was computed for national, rural, and urban populations. </li>
<li>The average ARC for rural populations (ARC_r) was 0.50, while the average national ARC was 0.28. </li>
</ul>

<b> Data Visualization: </b>
<ul>
<li>Created scatter plots and line charts to visualize the relationship between national and rural ARCs across different regions, with marker sizes representing population sizes. </li>
<li>Analyzed the distribution of ARC values and observed that rural areas experienced a larger increase in access compared to national levels. </li>
</ul>

<b> Regional Analysis: </b>
<ul>
<lil>Merged regional data with the original dataset to calculate the ARC for each  </lil>
<li> Identified that Latin America & Caribbean showed the greatest improvement in access to basic water services on a national level, with an average ARC of 0.315. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Key Findings: </h2>
<ul>
<li>28 countries had a 0% Annual Rate of Change for national populations, excluding those with 100% access. </li>
<li>Panama and Brazil had the highest absolute differences between urban and rural ARCs, with values of 2.33 and 1.72, respectively. </li>
<li> Countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region exhibited a greater spread in rural and national ARCs compared to other regions. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Key Skills and Tools Used: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Data Analysis: Cleaned and processed data, performed statistical calculations including ARC, and analyzed trends. </li>
<li> Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets: Assisted in formula application and data sorting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2> 
<p> This project highlights the disparities in water access across different regions and population types. By calculating the ARC, I was able to quantify changes in water access over time, providing insights into where improvements are happening and where challenges remain. </p>
